# Dungeons and dragons equipment tracker

https://bag-of-holding.netlify.app/

When playing RPGs with pen-and-paper it's difficult to keep track of what equipment the party has.
The plan is to create a website that is better than paper and better than a spreadsheet thanks to connectivity with an open DnD 5e API.
